I'm a developer passionate about **mathematics, statistics, and machine learning**, with a focus on **neural networks, and algorithmic problem-solving**. My projects prioritize **clarity and step-by-step logic** over raw performance, aiming to showcase both functionality and intuition.  

## **🛠️ Tech Stack**  
🔹 **Advanced:** Python  
🔹 **Beginner:** C, HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
🔹 **Libraries:** NumPy, TensorFlow, Keras, Textual   

## **📌 My Approach**  
💡 **Reinventing the Concept** – Creating from scratch gives a deeper understanding  
💡 **Understanding First, Optimization Second** – Focus on intuition and correctness  
🔍 **Showcasing Skills, Not Just Code** – Portfolio-oriented projects  
🎨 **Code Readability Matters** – Expressing complex ideas clearly
